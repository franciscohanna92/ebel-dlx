TODO
====
- Finish and verify floating point instructions assembly and simulation.
  (Not completed and not tested.)
- Some instructions are not implemented in the VM. ( mov** cvt** ).
- Parse the command line with a lex/yacc grammar to accept complex
  expressions.


KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND DEFICIENCIES
==================================
- The last line of the input file needs a <cr> to be accepted. Without the
  <cr>, you will obtain a "parse error".
